## Hi. I'm Casey.

It's been a long time since I've written with any expectation of an audience.
That isn't to say that I have expectations of readership even now, but at least I'm publishing again.
A blog may not be the most effective means -- but neither is a book, and people seem to get some traction with those.

The reason for this blog is that I have a deep need to contribute to positive social change, reveal the dark things that we all overlook, and try to get people _feeling and caring_.
If I could see a world I want, every eye would be filled with tears until none of them are.
I was born into this world very confused -- I had thought all through my childhood that, of course, everything would have an answer.

I thought that curiosity would be enough, up until I found the questions _nobody_ has ever answered.
Not the kind that bear out with study, like the color of the sky, but the kind that never do reveal their truths.

Questions of why people are made to suffer by way of other people not caring enough.
Questions of how it is that people will sell out their entire species and the planet just to keep a job.
Questions about inequality, human rights, and what heartlessness has covered this world.

I have very little to tell you about myself. But, I have a lot to say. You can call me Casey, if you must call me.
